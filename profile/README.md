# Neural Garage 🧠🔧

**AI-powered code analysis and maintenance tools**

> Next-generation developer tooling built in Rust for LLM-first workflows

---

## Our Mission

Neural Garage builds blazingly fast, intelligent code analysis tools designed for the AI era. We combine the precision of mechanical engineering with the intelligence of neural networks to help developers maintain healthy, high-quality codebases.

## Tools

### 🪦 [bury](https://github.com/neural-garage/bury)
**Dead code detector** - Find and eliminate unused functions, classes, and methods using reachability analysis.

- ⚡ Blazingly fast (written in Rust)
- 🐍 Python & TypeScript support
- 🎯 Entry point auto-detection
- 📊 LLM-friendly JSON output
- 🔄 CI/CD integration ready

### 🔮 Coming Soon

- **neural-complexity** - Code complexity analyzer with AI-powered suggestions
- **neural-context** - LLM context generator for optimal AI-assisted development
- **neural-refactor** - AI-powered refactoring recommendations
- **neural-inspect** - Comprehensive code health diagnostics

## Philosophy

Traditional code analysis tools were built for human consumption. Neural Garage tools are **LLM-first**:

- **Structured output** - JSON-first for AI consumption
- **Context-aware** - Call graphs, dependencies, complexity metrics
- **Performance-critical** - Rust-powered for instant analysis
- **Actionable insights** - Clear, automated recommendations
